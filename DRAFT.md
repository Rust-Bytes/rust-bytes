## CodeCrafters: Become a Better Rust Engineer
CodeCrafters created amazing [Rust courses](https://app.codecrafters.io/join?via=rust-bytes) that push your skills beyond the basics.

You’ll have fun building real-world projects from scratch, including Git, Docker, Redis, Kafka, SQLite, Grep, BitTorrent, HTTP Server, an Interpreter, and DNS.

The courses are self-paced, so you can learn at your own speed.

If you’re itching to level up your Rust skills, [these courses](https://app.codecrafters.io/join?via=rust-bytes) are perfect for you.

Here’s what makes CodeCrafters stand out:

- Learn by building projects that challenge you beyond just implementing CRUD features.

- Strengthen your fundamentals by working on awesome low-level projects.

- Get really good at reading and writing idiomatic Rust code.

- Join a community of talented engineers from MAANG companies and learn best practices from the pros.

- Plus, take part in monthly contests for a chance to win exciting prizes.

You can get your CodeCrafters fees fully reimbursed through your corporate Learning & Development (L&D) budget.

Be sure to check with your employer about tapping into your L&D budget to save money and make this a no-brainer opportunity to level up your skills.
