# Goodbye Async-Std, Welcome Smol
## Today‚Äôs Issue: I Can‚Äôt Believe That‚Äôs Legal Rust, Memory Safety for Web Fonts, and Extending Futures in Rust

Hello Rustaceans! ü¶Ä

Welcome to another edition of Rust Bytes newsletter.

In this issue, we‚Äôll discuss why async-std was deprecated and what to do next, challenge you to reverse a word in-place without reallocating, spotlight an amazing Rust project, and share some incredible links of the week.

Here‚Äôs issue 59 for you!

### A Message for You
In our [49th issue](https://weeklyrust.substack.com/p/why-fish-shell-was-rewritten-in-rust) of this newsletter, we celebrated our first anniversary (December 18) and we promised a compilation of all the challenges and tips we‚Äôve shared throughout the newsletter, combined into one book.

Well, the compilation is now ready. You can now get it for free in [EPUB](https://rustaceaneditor.gumroad.com/l/daerw), [PDF](https://rustaceaneditor.gumroad.com/l/daerw), or [website](https://rustaceaneditor.gumroad.com/l/daerw) format. It contains 45+ challenges, quizzes, and tips to get your hands dirty writing Rust. If you‚Äôre generous enough to support us, you can pledge any amount you‚Äôd like.

The book is also open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-bytes/weekly-challenges), so if you encounter any issues, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request (PR), and we‚Äôll be more than happy to assist.

Now onto our main thing.

## THE MAIN THING
### Goodbye Async-Std, Welcome Smol
The Rust standard library (std) still lacks native support for asynchronous operations, meaning if you need support for async functionality you must rely on third-party crates like async-std, tokio, monoio, or smol.

These crates provide async executors, enabling execution of asynchronous code in Rust.

However, there has been a significant shift in the async Rust ecosystem: async-std, a popular crate for async programming, has been officially deprecated.

Josh Triplett the maintainer of async-std, [shared the news on GitHub](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std), marking the end of an era for the project.

The async-std team has recommended that all users and crates built on async-std migrate to smol, a lightweight and efficient alternative that shares a similar API structure.

#### Why the Shift from Async-std to Smol?
Async-std was created to mirror the Rust standard library (std) as closely as possible, but in an async context, offering familiar APIs with the power of async/await.

It provided features like single-allocation task creation, an adaptive lock-free executor, and a threadpool, for high throughput with low latency.

However async-std had already been using smol‚Äôs executor under the hood for some time.

This overlap, combined with smol‚Äôs simpler design and active maintenance, makes it a natural successor.

Smol prioritizes simplicity and predictable performance, especially in terms of tail latency, over raw throughput, a trade-off that many users would prefer.

Unlike tokio, which is often seen as an opinionated ecosystem, smol is a tiny, unopinionated set of async building blocks.

This flexibility allows smol-based systems to run within tokio (but not vice versa), making it a better choice for crate authors.

#### What Does This Mean for Async-std Users?
If you‚Äôre currently using async-std in your projects, the transition to smol should be straightforward.

The two crates share a similar API layout, meaning most of your existing code can be adapted with minimal changes.

For example, a simple async-std task like this:

```rust
use async_std::task;

async fn say_hello() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

fn main() {
    task::block_on(say_hello())
}
```
can be rewritten with smol as:

```rust
use smol::block_on;

async fn say_hello() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

fn main() {
    block_on(say_hello());
}
```
The smol crate is designed to ‚Äújust work‚Äù without requiring you to manually set-up an executor.

The deprecation of async-std marks the end of a chapter, but it also paves the way for a more consolidated async Rust ecosystem.

The async-std team‚Äôs decision to recommend smol shows their dedication to the Rust community‚Äôs long-term health, choosing unity over a fragmented ecosystem.

Long live async-std‚Äîcatch you in the next life, or perhaps in a parallel async universe.


## RUST CHALLENGE ü¶Ä
Last week, we shared with you a useful Rust Tip on efficiently swapping values without cloning.

Let's move on to this week‚Äôs challenge.

#### Reverse Words In-Place
Write a Rust function that takes a mutable string sentence as input and reverses each word in-place, while keeping the order of the words the same.

Words are separated by a single space, and you must preserve leading and trailing spaces if they exist.

Do not use any external crates, stick to the standard library. The function should modify the input string directly and not allocate a new string.

## PROJECT SPOTLIGHT üí°
### KANI : Rust Verifier

Kani Logo
The Kani Rust Verifier is a bit-precise model checker for Rust.

Built for the Rust programming language, Kani uses bit-precise model checking to ensure your code stands up to scrutiny especially in those tricky, unsafe corners where Rust‚Äôs usual safety nets don‚Äôt reach.

Think of it as a supercharged proofreader for your Rust projects, catching bugs that traditional testing might miss.

#### What Problem It Tries to Solve
Rust is loved for its performance and safety guarantees, but those guarantees don‚Äôt cover everything.

Unsafe code blocks where developers bypass the compiler‚Äôs checks for flexibility can introduce subtle bugs like null pointer dereferences, panics, or arithmetic overflows.

Even safe Rust can have logical errors or runtime issues that slip past unit tests.

Kani tackles this by providing a way to prove your code‚Äôs correctness beyond what the compiler or traditional testing can achieve, bridging the gap between Rust‚Äôs static assurances and real-world reliability needs.

#### What Makes Kani Tick
- Kani doesn‚Äôt guess, it verifies with exactness, catching edge cases that fuzzers or tests might overlook.
- Specially designed to handle Rust‚Äôs ‚Äúunsafe superpowers,‚Äù making it a lifesaver for low-level systems programming.
- Works with Cargo, uses familiar harness syntax, and even hooks into GitHub Actions for CI, verification feels like testing, but stronger.
- With kani::any(), you‚Äôre not just testing a few values, you‚Äôre proving behavior across all possibilities, no exhaustive enumeration needed.

Applied to projects like Firecracker and the Rust Standard Library, proving its chops on complex, high-stakes codebases.

The Kani Rust Verifier project is open-source on GitHub at [https://github.com/model-checking/kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani).
